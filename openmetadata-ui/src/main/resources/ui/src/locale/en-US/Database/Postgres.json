You can check the version list [here](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/).\n\n### Usage and Lineage considerations\n\nWhen extracting lineage and usage information from Postgres we base our finding on the `pg_stat_statements` table.\nYou can find more information about it on the official [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html#id-1.11.7.39.6).\n\nAnother interesting consideration here is explained in the following SO [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50803147/what-is-the-timeframe-for-pg-stat-statements).\nAs a summary:\n- The `pg_stat_statements` has no time data embedded in it.\n- It will show all queries from the last reset (one can call `pg_stat_statements_reset()`).\n\nThen, when extracting usage and lineage data, the query log duration will have no impact, only the query limit.\n\n> - For usage and lineage grant your user `pg_read_all_stats` permission.\n\n```sql\nGRANT pg_read_all_stats TO your_user;\n```"
